            <p className="para">When you rent a car, you'll be offered expensive rental car insurance
                to cover any damages. This can cost upwards of $10 to $25 per day,
                and you may not need it, even if your auto insurance doesn't cover rental cars.
                Many major credit cards provide insurance on car rentals at no additional cost.
            </p>
            <h3 className="Points">2. But Credit Cards May Not Cover Everything</h3>
            <p className="para">When you call to check your credit card's policy on rental cars,
                ask specifically what they cover. Some credit card companies may cover any damages
                you incur on the rental car, but will not pay fees assessed by the rental car company.
                These fees can add up. If you decide that you need additional coverage.
            </p>
            <h3 className="Points">3. Every Driver Counts — and Costs</h3>
            <p className="para">Even if all your drivers are over the age of 25, you will likely 
            pay a fee for each additional driver registered when you rent the car.
             Think carefully about how many drivers you need. Designate one or two
              to keep from incurring additional fees.
            </p>
            <h3 className="Points">4. Youth Drivers Cost Even More</h3>
            <p className="para">
            For a long time, rental car companies wouldn't even allow drivers under 21.
             Now, most do, but a hefty fee can be part of the young driver's experience—usually,
              a daily fee for putting a young driver (under 25) on the registration.
